overall notes



=============================================

specific & pseudocode

put, repl to compound
  hier_pre  : update root resc access_time 
  hier_post : delete root resc access_time 
  acPostProcFor(Put,Repl): 
    if ( $KVPAIrs is cch || is arc )
       update access_time on parent
       set  access_time on root to 0

#-----------------------------------

cache clear phase:

  for each compound resc clearable 

    mark root as being cleared -- (set crit_flag=3  to bar access if urgent)

    check hier up from compound node for access_time

    if too young, abort this resc-clear

    query d-objs that qualify to clear
